# Project Title
Advanced Programming Languages lesson from Epic Institute of Technology

## Description
This repo provides a collection of Python scripts and tools for various tasks, including tokenization, parsing, and evaluation of mathematical expressions.

## Features
* Tokenization and parsing of mathematical expressions
* Evaluation of expressions using a visitor pattern
* Support for various data formats, including Eson and EpicLang
* Integration with the LLVM library for code generation and execution

## File Descriptions

### Tokenization and Parsing
* `hw1.new\01_tokenize\main.py`: A tokenization script using a custom lexer generated by ANTLR
* `hw1.new\01_tokenize\Tokenize.py`: A lexer class generated by ANTLR4.13.1 from a grammar file `Tokenize.g4`
* `Lexer and parser\1\calc.py`: A basic calculator that parses and evaluates mathematical expressions using ANTLR

### Eson and EpicLang
* `hw1.new\02_eson\EsonLexer.py`: A lexer for the Eson data format generated from an ANTLR4 grammar file
* `hw2\EpicLangLexer.py`: A lexer for the EpicLang language generated from an ANTLR4 grammar file
* `hw2\interp.py`: An interpreter for the EpicLang language

### LLVM Integration
* `hw4\task1.py`: A script that generates and executes LLVM IR code using the LLVM library

To use the scripts, simply run them with Python, providing the required input files or arguments. For example:
```bash
python hw1.new\01_tokenize\main.py
python hw2\interp.py example.epiclang
python hw4\task1.py
```
